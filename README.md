1. Project Overview
The AI Quiz App is an interactive web application that allows users to select a topic and receive a dynamically generated quiz with multiple-choice questions created by an AI model. After completing the quiz, users receive personalized feedback based on their performance.

Key Features:
> Topic selection interface.
> AI-generated quiz questions (5 per quiz).
> User answer tracking.
> AI-generated personalized feedback.
> Responsive and user-friendly UI.

2. Frontend Technology Stack

Framework and Language
> React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
> TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing for better developer experience and fewer runtime errors.

Key Libraries and Tools
> Create React App (CRA): Bootstraps the React project with TypeScript support.
> Axios: For making HTTP requests to the AI backend API.
> CSS: Styling the app with custom CSS files.




Project Structure (Frontend)

├── components/
│   ├── TopicSelection.tsx      # Topic selection UI
│   ├── LoadingScreen.tsx       # Loading indicator UI
│   ├── QuizScreen.tsx          # Quiz question display and answer input
│   ├── ResultsScreen.tsx       # Display quiz results and feedback
├── services/
│   └── aiService.ts            # Handles AI API calls (quiz generation, feedback)
├── types.ts                    # Shared TypeScript interfaces (Question, QuizData)
├── App.tsx                    # Main app component managing state and screens
├── App.css                    # Styling for the app

Component Responsibilities
> TopicSelection: Lets users pick a quiz topic.
> LoadingScreen: Shows a spinner or message while waiting for AI responses.
> QuizScreen: Displays questions and options, collects user answers.
> ResultsScreen: Shows score and AI-generated feedback.
> App.tsx: Controls app state, screen transitions, and data flow.

3. Backend Technology Stack (AI Services)

AI Provider
> OpenRouter API: A gateway to various AI models (e.g., Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini).
> Models Used: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet for question generation and feedback.
API Communication
> Axios: Used in aiService.ts to send POST requests to OpenRouter endpoints.
Endpoints:
https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions for chat-based completions.
> Authentication: Bearer token (API key) passed in HTTP headers.
Data Flow
> Frontend calls generateQuizQuestions(topic) → sends prompt to AI → receives JSON array of questions.
> Frontend calls generateFeedback(topic, score, totalQuestions) → sends prompt to AI → receives feedback string.
> Both functions handle JSON parsing, validation, and error handling.
4. Frontend-Backend Interaction

> The frontend is a single-page React app that manages UI and state.
> The backend is serverless API accessed via HTTP requests.
> The app sends prompts to the AI API to generate quiz content dynamically.
> Responses are parsed and integrated into the UI.
> User answers are collected and scored locally.
> Feedback is generated by sending the score and topic back to the AI API.

5. Summary and Extensions
Benefits
> Dynamic quiz content without manual question creation.
> Personalized feedback enhances learning.
> Modern React + TypeScript stack ensures maintainability and scalability.

Possible Extensions
> Add user authentication and save quiz history.
> Support more question types (true/false, fill-in-the-blank).
> Add timer and scoring analytics.
> Use environment variables for API keys in production.
> Deploy backend proxy for better security.
